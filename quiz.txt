Weekly quiz
===========

It is expected that you will not have time to answer all questions. Try to answer at least one question from each section. (Questions nearer the top of each section are more important to know.)

Ruby basics
-----------

1) Describe the following ruby objects:
for instance [1,2,3] would be "an array containing three elements, the integer 1, the integer 2 and the integer 3"
and "" would be "a blank string"

1a) :crocodile

a symbol

1b) "145.73"

A string containing a  the number 145.73

1c) { :coffee => "cafe" }

a hash with a key of :coffee and a value of “cafe”

1d) [ :green, :eggs, :ham ]

an array with the following symbols :green, :eggs, :ham

1e) ["tea", {"juice" => "orange"}]

An array containing a string as the first element and the second element is a hash with one element

2) Here is an array:
array = ["Molly", "Greg", "Taz"]
Write a line of ruby that appends the values "Jay" and "Mona" to the array.

array << “Jay”
==> [“Molly", "Greg", "Taz”, “Jay”] 

array << “Mona”
==> [“Molly", "Greg", "Taz”, “Jay”, “Mona”] 


3) Here is a hash:
hash = { :cow => "Moo", :sheep => "Baah" }
Write a line of ruby that replaces the value of the key :sheep with "Bleat".

hash[:sheep] = “Bleat”
==> hash = { :cow => "Moo", :sheep => "Bleat" }

4) The file number_converter.rb contains a method called convert_number that doesn't do anything.

Replace the #??? comment inside it so that:
  if the argument passed is greater than 5, it returns 3 times the number,
  and if it is less than or equal to 5 it returns the number minus 3.

5) Write a method that takes one argument (an array full of strings) and `puts` each word separately, but in uppercase.

strings = [ “h”, “array”, “bang”]

def output_uppercased_letters(strings)
 strings.each do |string|
  puts string.upcase
 end
end

output_uppercased_letters(strings)
==> [ “H”, “ARRAY”, “BANG”]


6) What's the difference between an object and an instance?

An object is representation of thing in the world and an instance is the individual representation for example we have a car object this can have many instances for example a ford card which is red.


Testing
-------
7) robot.rb contains a simple class with two methods. robot_spec.rb is the start of a spec file - it runs, but there aren't any tests in it.

a) Write a test that checks greet('Ada') returns the string "HELLO ADA".
b) Write a test that checks calculate(4, 5) returns 9.
c) Write a test that checks calculate(5, 'horse') returns 5.

8) Explain the difference between the rspec methods let and subject.

subject refers to the object main object your testing and let refers to the other objects which are in the tests for example your testing a User spec so the subject would be the User and 
there’s also subscribers so within the it would be let(:subscriber) { Subscriber.new }, let can also be used to test additional variables for example you want to change the name of the user for one test.

HTML, CSS and Javascript
------------------------

8) In a sentance, describe:
a) what is HTML?
b) what is CSS?
c) what is Javascript?

HTML provides structure to a webpage by allowing developers to use html elements to build a webpage, css provides the styling of html document for example the Headings colour, the styling of the words etc.. Javascript gives a webpage the behaviour according to events it listens to for example when a user clicks an image which fires off an event such as resizing the image.

9) State if the following lines are HTML, CSS,or Javascript:

a) <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
HTML

b) console.log("Some words");
Javascript

c) p { background-color: yellow }
CSS

d) <table width="50%"></table>
HTML and inline CSS


e) <div id="index" class="small left"></div>
HTML

10) Describe the following Javascript objects, like you did for the first question:

10a) 100.26
A number object with the number 100.26

10b) "Hello"
A string object with the string hello enclosed. 

10c) [ "a", 4, null ]

an array object containing the following elements a string as the first element, a number as the second object and a null as the third object.

10d) { height: "180cm" }

a hash object containing a height key and a value string object “180cm”
